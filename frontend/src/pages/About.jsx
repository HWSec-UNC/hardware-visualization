        <h2>What is SEIF?</h2>
        <p>
          SEIF (Symbolic Execution for Information Flow) is an advanced framework designed 
          to analyze and verify information flow in hardware designs. It leverages symbolic 
          execution to identify and eliminate false paths while ensuring security properties 
          are upheld.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Sylvia?</h2>
        <p>
          Sylvia is an open-source symbolic execution engine that integrates with SEIF to 
          efficiently explore hardware designs and verify security constraints. It helps 
          overcome the path explosion problem, making hardware verification faster and 
          more scalable.
